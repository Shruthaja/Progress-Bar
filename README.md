#Progress Bar

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- The progress bar will automatically adjust based on the current date.

## Code Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure, styles, and scripts for the progress bar.
- **CSS and JavaScript**: Inline styles and scripts are included within the HTML file for simplicity.

## Technical Details

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the progress bar.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive design and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Calculates the current date's progress through the year and updates the progress bar dynamically.
- **jQuery**: Utilized for hover effects on the progress bar.

## Future Improvements

- Add the ability to track progress for other years.
- Implement a more detailed progress tracking system (e.g., months, days).
- Enhance styling with additional animations or effects.
